# note-taker-app

## Description

This challenge for the UofT fullstack coding bootcamp was designed to test my knowledge on routes and working with express.  I challenged my ability and knowledge to write code that allows me to create and read stored data, stored other than the local storage.    

## Usage

When you load the inital page you will have a start button that will bring you to the notes page.  From here you can create a new note by typing in a title and text, and then save that note by clicking the floppy disk icon that appears in the top right hand corner.  Once saved, your new note will appear on the left, you can read it by clicking on it.
